# Stable Diffusion
## Jupyter Notebook POC

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to develop and demonstrate a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for **HEMA**. The project was undertaken as part of an internship and explores the application of generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, as a **concept AI designer**.

The primary goal was to train a Stable Diffusion model on a custom dataset and then run this model to generate new images. It is important to highlight that the work presented here is a **POC** intended to showcase the potential capabilities and workflow for such an AI-driven design tool, rather than a production-ready system.

## Notebooks

The core components of this POC are two Jupyter Notebooks:

* **[TRAIN](https://github.com/jasperveraart/Stable-Diffusion-Jupyter-Notebook-/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_TRAINER.ipynb)**: This notebook details the process of training the Stable Diffusion model. It includes steps for data preparation, model configuration, and the training loop itself.
* **[RUN](https://github.com/jasperveraart/Stable-Diffusion-Jupyter-Notebook-/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_RUN.ipynb)**: This notebook allows you to run the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model (either a general one or the one trained using the TRAIN notebook) to generate images based on textual prompts.

## Context

* **Project Type**: Internship Project
* **Organization**: HEMA
* **Objective**: Develop a Proof of Concept for an AI-powered design tool.
* **Status**: Proof of Concept (POC)

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the notebooks in an environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks with the necessary dependencies for Stable Diffusion (e.g., Google Colab, a local setup with a suitable GPU).
3.  Follow the instructions within each notebook to either train a new model or run an existing one.

## Disclaimer

This project is a **Proof of Concept** and is not intended for direct production use without significant further development, testing, and validation. The models and code are provided for demonstration and research purposes.
